Project Description: Loan Data Processing with NumPy
This project involves working with a loan dataset, leveraging NumPy to perform various data preprocessing tasks. The dataset contains both numerical and string data, and the goal is to clean and transform it for analysis.

Key steps include:

Data Loading:

The dataset is loaded using np.genfromtxt(), handling missing values and utilizing options like autostrip to clean up the data.
Missing Values Detection:

The code identifies columns with missing values by iterating through the dataset and applying np.isnan().
Handling Missing Data:

Missing data is filled with a temporary value generated based on the maximum value in the dataset.
Splitting Data:

The dataset is split into numerical and string columns, allowing for separate handling of each data type.
Statistics Generation:

The project calculates basic statistics such as mean, min, and max for the numeric columns.
Techniques Used:
NumPy: For data manipulation and processing.
Missing Data Handling: Detecting and replacing missing values with placeholders.
Dataset Splitting: Separating the dataset into numerical and categorical (string) data.
Basic Descriptive Statistics: Calculating summary statistics to understand the dataset better.
This project is designed as a preprocessing step to prepare the loan dataset for further analysis or modeling tasks.
