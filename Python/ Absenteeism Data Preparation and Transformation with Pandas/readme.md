This project involves the systematic cleaning and transformation of an absenteeism dataset to prepare it for advanced analysis. The process begins by removing irrelevant columns, such as the unique 'ID' identifier, to streamline the dataset. The categorical 'Reason for Absence' column is split into dummy variables and grouped logically into four main categories for easier interpretation and analysis. Date-related transformations are performed, extracting month and day of the week information and removing the original date column.

Additionally, the 'Education' variable is transformed into a binary format to simplify modeling. To ensure accuracy, checkpoints are created at each major step, allowing validation against the clean final dataset. The result is a structured, analysis-ready DataFrame that mirrors the organized structure of df_cleaned.csv.
