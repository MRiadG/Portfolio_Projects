# Database Creation: Queries and Initial Data

To create the database and tables, download the **"Database and Data Creation.rar"** file and extract its contents. 

Follow these steps to set up your database:

1. Create a new database named **`gdb023`**.
2. Execute the SQL queries provided in the extracted files to create the necessary tables and populate them with data.

## The main queries for data retrieval can be found in the **"data retrieving.sql"** file.
