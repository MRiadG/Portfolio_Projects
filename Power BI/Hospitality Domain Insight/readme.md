# Hotel Booking Analytics: Week-on-Week Performance Analysis Using Power BI

Description: This project presents a detailed Week-on-Week (WoW) analysis of hotel booking data using Power BI. By utilizing five datasets—dim_date, dim_hotels, dim_rooms, fact_aggregated_bookings, and fact_bookings—the report examines weekly fluctuations in bookings, revenue, and customer behavior. WoW analysis provides insights into trends such as booking growth or decline, room occupancy rates, and platform-specific booking patterns.

By tracking key performance metrics week-by-week, stakeholders can easily identify improvement areas and optimize hotel operations for better resource allocation and strategic planning. This analysis aids in making informed decisions based on real-time shifts in booking performance and market dynamics.
