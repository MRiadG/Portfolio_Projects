# Employee Attendance Tracker with Leave and Holiday Management
Discussion: This project aimed to create a comprehensive attendance tracking system by consolidating employee attendance data with leave allowance information. The dataset included two sheetsâ€”one for daily attendance and another for leave allotments. In the attendance sheet, employees marked as "A" were absent, but some absences were due to their approved leave, while others were truly absent without leave. The leave sheet provided specific information about which employees were allowed to take leave on particular days.
