# Project:Streamlining Attendance Data for Efficient MIS Reporting.

#About The Project
The above data is received from software that maintains attendance & provides daily attendance in excel format, but this data is not useful to find out daily attendance in a short summary. 
It is showing very vast data which is looking very complicated. so here in this project, I have converted the attendance data from vertical format to horizontal format properly.

2 Purpose
From the above data, we will prepare a useful MIS report which will summarize the attendance of each employee in one line. This report will be valuable for our office use.
